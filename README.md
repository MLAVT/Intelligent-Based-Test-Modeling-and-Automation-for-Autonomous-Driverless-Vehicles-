**Overview**

The autonomous vehicle (AV) industry is experiencing unprecedented growth, projected to reach a global market value of USD 556.67 billion by 2026, expanding from USD 54.63 billion in 2019 at a staggering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.47%. Key players like Tesla are capitalizing on this trend, leveraging advancements in both autonomous driving and electric vehicle technologies. Alongside this, the market for AV simulation—an essential tool for testing and validating AV systems in controlled environments—is also on the rise, expected to grow from USD 1.5 billion in 2020 at a CAGR of 7.2% through 2025. This study introduces an advanced intelligent framework for supervised testing and validation of autonomous vehicles. It integrates cutting-edge computer vision technologies and dynamic simulation tools to handle core AV functionalities. The framework incorporates sophisticated models such as:

YOLOv10 for high-accuracy object detection,

METE-CNN for weather classification,

Mask R-CNN for detailed road and signage segmentation, and

DBSCAN for clustering intersection types.

These tools collectively enable precise detection and classification of critical environmental elements, including objects, intersection types, traffic signals, and weather conditions.

A key innovation of the framework is the development of an Integrated Semantic Spanning Tree Model. This model systematically organizes dynamic driving elements—such as moving and stationary objects, traffic conditions, vehicle signals, road lanes, and weather dynamics—into structured input-output trees. This structured approach facilitates the systematic generation, validation, and automation of diverse test cases, mimicking real-world driving scenarios. The system leverages an AI-powered tool to create, validate, and visualize a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that AVs are equipped to comprehend and respond to complex driving conditions. By streamlining the testing and validation process, the framework offers a robust pathway to enhancing the reliability and safety of autonomous driving technologies, paving the way for their broader adoption.
